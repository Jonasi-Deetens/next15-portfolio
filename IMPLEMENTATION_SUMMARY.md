## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Three user roles with different permission levels:

```typescript
enum UserRole {
  USER          // Basic user access
  ADMIN         // User management + app administration
  SUPER_ADMIN   // Full system access
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Middleware in tRPC routers checks user role
- Dashboard navigation hides admin-only routes from regular users
- Admin procedures throw `FORBIDDEN` error for unauthorized access

### 2. User Management (Admin Only)

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ View all users with detailed information
- ✅ Create new users with role assignment
- ✅ Edit user information (name, email)
- ✅ Change user roles
- ✅ Suspend/activate user accounts
- ✅ Delete users (with confirmation)
- ✅ View user statistics

**Safeguards:**
- Cannot change own role (prevents accidental demotion)
- Cannot suspend own account
- Cannot delete own account
- All actions are logged in ActivityLog

### 3. Dashboard Layout

**Features:**
- Responsive sidebar navigation (collapsible on mobile)
- Active route highlighting
- User profile section at bottom
- Role-based menu filtering
- Smooth transitions and animations

**Routes:**
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard with statistics
- `/dashboard/apps` - App marketplace
- `/dashboard/users` - User management (admin only)
- `/dashboard/analytics` - Analytics (placeholder)
- `/dashboard/settings` - User settings

### 4. Activity Logging

All administrative actions are logged:
- User creation
- User updates
- Role changes
- Status changes
- User deletion

Log entries include:
- Action type
- User who performed the action
- Entity affected
- Metadata (what changed)
- Timestamp

### 5. Type Safety

Full type safety from database to frontend:

```typescript
// Backend defines the contract
export const userRouter = router({
  getAllWithDetails: adminProcedure.query(async () => {
    return await db.user.findMany({
      include: { posts: true, installedApps: true }
    });
  }),
});

// Frontend gets automatic type inference
const { data: users } = trpc.user.getAllWithDetails.useQuery();
// users is fully typed with User[] including relations!
```

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- JWT tokens for session management
- Session stored server-side with expiration
- Google OAuth integration (optional)

### Authorization
- Middleware-based permission checks
- Role verification on every admin API call
- Frontend route protection
- Prevents privilege escalation (can't modify own role)

### Data Protection
- User passwords never exposed in API responses
- Activity logging for accountability
- Soft delete capabilities (status: SUSPENDED vs DELETE)
